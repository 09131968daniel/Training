# Intro

This week you will be focusing on studying for AWS Certifications. The one that Revature recommends you take is the `AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner` exam; however, you are technically allowed to go straight to the `AWS Solutions Architect - Associate` exam if you feel so inclined. The following sections include resources for your studies.

# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

This is the most beginner Certification that AWS has. It is not necessarily a pre-requisite to any other cert. There are many different ways in which you can prepare for the certification exam, but in general the recommendation is to use as many reputable resources as possible to get a well-rounded understanding of the material. The following link is the Exam Guide according to AWS:

- [Official AWS Exam Guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-cloud-practitioner/AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner_Exam-Guide.pdf)

AWS also has several whitepapers available that you should read:

- [AWS Overview](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-overview.pdf)
- [Pricing Whitepaper](http://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws_pricing_overview.pdf)
- [Architecting for the Cloud Whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS_Cloud_Best_Practices.pdf)
- [Well-Architected Framework Whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf)

There is also a set of free 6-hour course you can take with AWS if you like videos more than reading:

- [Digital Course](https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/cloud-practitioner-essentials/)

Before you take the test, some people also prefer to take practice tests. I would either recommend buying a set of practice exams from Udemy (usually <\$15), or scheduling the practice version of your exam with your testing organization before taking the real thing.

## Extra materials:

# AWS Solutions Architect - Associate

This is one of the most popular AWS Certifications. It is much harder than the AWS CCP, but it is also much more sought after.

Here is a study guide for preparing for the SAA Exam:

A lot of people also like to take prep courses on Udemy for this exam. AWS also has some free videos regarding the SAA:

- [Exam Readiness](https://www.aws.training/Details/Curriculum?id=20685)

I highly recommend taking some practice tests before taking the real exam (many are available on Udemy for <\$15), or you can schedule a practice version of the exam before taking the real thing.
